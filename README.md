## Notes

* Divide & Conquer
  - Divide big problem into smaller sub-problems
  - Use recursion
    * Divide again into smaller sub-problems if needed
  - Concept of a base case to identify when it's time to 'solve'/'conquer'
  - Conquer => Solve smaller problems and build them back up to a full solution
